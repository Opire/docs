# Introduction

Tips are a feature provided by Opire to express gratitude for a user's efforts/knowledge **without expecting anything in return**. Since they are not directly related to solving a particular issue, they can be used in both issues and PRs; you just need to know the **amount to pay** and the **user to whom you want to give it**.

[Here](/overview/commands#tip-a-user) you can see how to give tips using the corresponding command within repositories that have [our app installed](/overview/install-app).

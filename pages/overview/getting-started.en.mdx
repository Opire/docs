# Getting Started

## As a Codeowner

1. **Install the [app](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/install-app)**

<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>This app allows any user to use Opire commands in repositories where it's installed, enabling interaction with the Opire platform without leaving your GitHub repository.</span>
<br/><br/>
<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>We recommend notifying your community that you are using Opire, so they can create rewards themselves or keep an eye on resolving issues. You can modify the `README.md` of the repositories, communicate it in the community forum, announce it on Discord, etc...</span>

2. **Create your first reward using [our commands](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/commands#create-reward) (or let others create it for you)**

<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>If you are going to create rewards in your own repositories, check the section ["As a Reward Creator"](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/getting-started#as-a-reward-creator).</span>

## As a Reward Creator

1. **Create your first reward using [our commands](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/commands#create-reward)**

<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>With Opire, **anyone can create rewards** in repositories that have the app installed. Rewards can start [from $20](https://docs.opire.dev/rewards/pricing). In addition to adding rewards to issues, anyone can appreciate a user's effort with tips starting [from $5](https://docs.opire.dev/tips/pricing).</span>
<br/><br/>
<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>An issue can have associated [multiple rewards](https://docs.opire.dev/rewards/workflow#multiple-rewards), whether it's the same user creating them or multiple contributors providing different amounts: **at the time of payment, each user will be responsible for paying their share**.</span>
<br/><br/>
<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>If an external person to the repository organization creates a reward, **the organization will [receive a percentage](https://docs.opire.dev/rewards/pricing#codeowner-percentage)** when it's paid to the programmer.</span>

2. **Pay when someone claims your rewards associated with the issue**

<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>Once the programmer has claimed the rewards for the issue and it has been verified that the proposed change meets expectations, you can pay the rewards you have created for that issue from [your dashboard](https://app.opire.dev/dashboard/creator/rewards). In case there are multiple programmers who have claimed the same issue, you can choose which one to pay. It is **the developer's responsibility to ensure that their account is correctly configured** to receive payments.</span>
<br/><br/>
<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>This is the moment when the reward transfer will take place along with the charging of the [associated costs](https://docs.opire.dev/rewards/pricing).</span>
<br/><br/>
<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>If [multiple people create rewards for the same issue](https://docs.opire.dev/rewards/workflow#multiple-creators), each creator will be charged the corresponding amount so they'll only pay the sum of the rewards they have created.</span>

## As a Developer

1. **Ensure you have correctly configured the [payment system](https://docs.opire.dev/payments)**

<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>To receive payments through Opire, it is necessary to complete the [payment platform setup](https://docs.opire.dev/payments). Failure to do so will prevent reward creators from compensating you for your great effort.</span>

2. **Find a rewarded issue and try to solve it**

<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>[On our platform](https://app.opire.dev), you can search through all available rewards based on technology, price, etc. When you find an issue that you believe you can solve, [try it](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/commands#try-to-solve-the-issue) to let the world know that you intend to claim the associated rewards after you solve it.</span>

3. **Create a PR and [claim the reward](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/commands#claim-rewards-associated-with-an-issue)**

<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>Once you have the solution to the issue, create a PR and use [our commands](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/commands#claim-rewards-associated-with-an-issue) to claim the associated rewards.</span>
<br/><br/>
<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>This doesn't mean that you will be paid automatically. Reward creators will pay you when they confirm that your solution meets the requirements defined in the issue.</span>
<br/><br/>
<span style={{ color: 'grey'}}>Since the same issue can have multiple rewards associated from different creators, each of them will pay their share separately (possibly at different times). In [your dashboard](https://app.opire.dev/dashboard/programmer/rewards), you can always see the pending amount for the rewards you have claimed.</span>

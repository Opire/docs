# Introduction

## What is Opire?

Opire is a **rewards platform for software developers**.

This project borns with <u>a clear objective</u>: that **anyone can be able to live from open-source software**. This includes programmers who want to focus on developing software and improving open-source code, as well as owners and maintainers of open-source code who contribute to the community with their projects.

With Opire, **anyone can create rewards for open-source projects** and grow their community, while developers can solve issues and **earn the associated rewards**.

## How does it work?

Opire consists of two components: an [app](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/installations) (to install on GitHub) and a [web platform](https://app.opire.dev).

The app enables the use of different [commands](https://docs.opire.dev/overview/commands) directly integrated with GitHub to interact with the platform: create rewards, claim them, and more.

The web platform focuses on visualizing and managing rewards. Among other features, it allows advanced search (by technology, price, etc.), payment for claimed rewards, a history of the resolved ones, profile configuration, and more.

For a detailed view of the reward lifecycle, check out this [section](https://docs.opire.dev/rewards/workflow).

# Commands

These are the commands that can be used within repositories that have [our app installed](/overview/install-app).

<br/>
<InfoPanel>
To be able to use our commands, it's not necessary for you to have registered on Opire. If a repository has installed our app, anyone can use our commands.

Once you have logged in for the first time, we will synchronize the information with your account to show you the results of the interactions you have made so far through our commands (created rewards, etc).
</InfoPanel>

## Create Reward

> /reward [amount]

<br/>
<DimmedText>**Example:** `/reward 20`</DimmedText>
<br/><br/>

<span>Create a reward with the specified amount in dollars for the issue where the comment was made. Anyone can create rewards if the repository has the Opire app installed. Multiple rewards can be created for the same issue, and a single issue can have rewards from different creators.</span>
